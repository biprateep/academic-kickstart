I am a second year PhD student at the Department of Physics and Astronomy of the University of Pittsburgh. My primary research interests are cosmology, galaxy formation and evolution and applications of machine learning to solve problems in physics. I work with [Jeff Newman](https://janewman-pitt-edu.github.io/) and [Brett Andrews](https://bretthandrews.github.io/) here at Pitt and also as a part of the [Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/) collaboration on various aspects of the survey. I coordinate the Pittsburgh chapter of [Astronomy on Tap](https://www.facebook.com/AoTPGH/) and love doing science outreach!

Previously, I have worked on studying star formation in galaxies and searching for Pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). I grew up in the beautiful Indian city of [Agartala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agartala) and lived in Bhubaneswar for a few years before moving to Pittsburgh.
