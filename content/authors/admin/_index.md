I am a second year PhD student at the Department of Physics and Astronomy of the University of Pittsburgh. My primary research interests are observational cosmology, galaxy formation and evolution and applications of machine learning to solve problems in physics. I work with [Jeff Newman](http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~janewman) and [Brett Andrews](https://bretthandrews.github.io/) here at Pitt and also as a part of the [Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/) collaboration on various aspects of the survey. I coordinate the Pittsburgh chapter of Astronomy on Tap and love doing outreach!

Prior to Pittsburgh, I have worked on studying star formation in galaxies and searching for Pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). I grew up in Agartala, India and then moved to Bhubaneswar, India for my undergradutae studies at the National Institute of Science Education and Research.
